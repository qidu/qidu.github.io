`An Agent Development Kit`

> `adk` represents as dev tool for Agent, not for Android.

## Workflow Agents for coding
* Code Writer Agent
```python
# Takes the initial specification (from user query) and writes code.
code_writer_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="CodeWriterAgent",
    model=LiteLlm(model="custom_openai/deepseek-v3-0324"),
```

* Code Reviewer Agent
>
> **Review Criteria:**
> 1.  **Correctness:** Does the code work as intended? Are there logic errors?
> 2.  **Readability:** Is the code clear and easy to understand? Follows PEP 8 style guidelines?
> 3.  **Efficiency:** Is the code reasonably efficient? Any obvious performance bottlenecks?
> 4.  **Edge Cases:** Does the code handle potential edge cases or invalid inputs gracefully?
> 5.  **Best Practices:** Does the code follow common Python best practices?
```python
# Takes the code generated by the previous agent (read from state) and provides feedback.
code_reviewer_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="CodeReviewerAgent",
    model=LiteLlm(model="deepseek/deepseek-chat"),
```

* Code Refactorer Agent
```python
# Takes the original code and the review comments (read from state) and refactors the code.
code_refactorer_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="CodeRefactorerAgent",
    model=LiteLlm(model="custom_openai/deepseek-r1"),
```

* SequentialAgent runs pipline: Writer -> Reviewer -> Refactorer
```
code_pipeline_agent = SequentialAgent(
    name="CodePipelineAgent",
    sub_agents=[code_writer_agent, code_reviewer_agent, code_refactorer_agent],
    description=(
        "Executes a sequence of code writing, reviewing, and refactoring."
    ),
)
```
Then run the agent
```shell
adk run workflow_agent_seq

[user]: Write a sukudo game
```

## Toolbox Agent
This agent is utilizing [mcp toolbox for database](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/getting-started/introduction/) to assist end user based on the informaton stored in database.

* Run toolbox
```bash
toolbox --tools-file "tools.yaml"
```

* Run Toolbox Agent
```
adk run toolbox_agent

[user]: Could you book a hotel in Basel?
```

## Callback in Agent
Set callbacks before agent running, after agent running, before model request, after model response, before tool calling, after tool calling.
```python
root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model="custom_openai/deepseek-v3"),
    tools=[
        roll_die,
        check_prime,
    ],
    before_agent_callback=[before_agent_cb1, before_agent_cb2, before_agent_cb3],
    after_agent_callback=[after_agent_cb1, after_agent_cb2, after_agent_cb3],
    before_model_callback=before_model_callback,
    after_model_callback=after_model_callback,
    before_tool_callback=[before_tool_cb1, before_tool_cb2, before_tool_cb3],
    after_tool_callback=[after_tool_cb1, after_tool_cb2, after_tool_cb3],
)
```

Run the agent
```shell
adk run callbacks
[user]: roll a 10000-sides die and tell me if it is prime
@before_agent_cb1
@before_agent_cb2
@before_agent_cb3
@before_model_callback
...
```
