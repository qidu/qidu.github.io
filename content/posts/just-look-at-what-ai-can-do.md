“What's the next best step? And I find that whenever I do this myself, everything works out so much better. But it's hard. It's hard. It's a constant struggle with one's emotion. And that's why I mention it to you. Perhaps some of you will adopt it yourself. This is a reminder to adopt this mindset as best as one can. And also a reminder for myself. "

"There is something a little different going on right now. Anything which I can learn, anything which any one of you can learn, the AI could do as well. How do we know this, by the way? How can I be so sure? The reason is that all of us have a brain, and the brain is a biological computer. That's why we have a brain."

"The brain is a biological computer. So why can't the digital computer—a digital brain—do the same things?"

"It's very, very difficult to imagine. It's very difficult to internalize and to really believe on an emotional level. Even I struggle with it.“

"And I'm really condensing a lot into a small amount of information here—in time here. But overall, by simply `looking at what AI can do`, not ignoring it, when the time comes, that will generate the energy that's required to overcome the huge challenge that AI will pose."

"And in some sense, whether you like it or not, your life is going to be affected by AI to a great extent. And so `looking at it, paying attention, and then generating the energy to solve the problems that will come up`."
