Will we experience a `Cambrian explosion` of software, the same way we did with content?

## Storyline
### Before the internet
Media behaved very differently —— it was expensive to create. You had to pay people to make content, edit it, and distribute it. Because content was expensive to create, it had to make money. And consumers paid —— newspapers, magazines, books, cable, and pay per view. 

### When the internet happened
The Media companies viewed it as a way to reach broader audiences and reduce their distribution costs. But what no one saw coming was that the internet not only reduced distribution costs to zero, but it also drove the cost of creating content to zero. 
User generated content flourished, and when content doesn’t cost anything to create, it no longer has to make money. 

### When YouTube launched in 2005
Its first video, Me at the Zoo, seemed immaterial. This was the harbinger of doom for the media industry? But that was the point —— it proved that content had become too cheap to meter. Web 2.0 gave everyone a single verb: `upload`, and it vaporized newsrooms everywhere. 

### Everywhere in 2025
A person types an idea, presses enter, and a network of agents compiles, tests, and executes.

Software is expensive because developers are expensive. They are skilled translators —— they translate human language into computer language and vice-versa. LLMs have proven themselves to be remarkably efficient at this and will drive the cost of creating software to zero. What happens when software no longer has to make money?
