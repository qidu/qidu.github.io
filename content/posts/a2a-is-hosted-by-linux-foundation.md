The A2A(Agent2Agent) protocol addresses the growing need for agents to operate in dynamic, multi-agent environments, coordinating actions across a wide array of applications and data infrastructure. A2A enables autonomous agents to discover one another, exchange information securely and collaborate across systems. This allows developers and organizations to unite agents from multiple sources and platforms, improving modularity, mitigating vendor lock-in and accelerating innovation.

> The protocol enables agentic AI interoperability and trusted agent communication across systems and platforms.

Under the Linux Foundation’s governance, A2A will remain vendor neutral, emphasize inclusive contributions and continue the protocol’s focus on extensibility, security and real-world usability across industries.

> By joining the Linux Foundation, A2A formalizes its commitment to an open, collaborative ecosystem – offering greater autonomy and multiplying productivity.
