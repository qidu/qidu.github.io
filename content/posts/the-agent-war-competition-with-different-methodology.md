`Distinct approaches to implementing Agentic AI`:

- Microsoft adopts a "Universal Platform" strategy, aiming to build an `AI operating system` that reshapes the software ecosystem by overhauling its underlying architecture. Its Agents act as cross-system intelligent hubs, replacing traditional databases and business logic, shifting from an "App Stack" to an "Agent Stack".
- Salesforce follows a "Vertical Integration" approach, embedding Agents deeply into `CRM and specific workflows` within its existing SaaS business, enhancing task autonomy without disrupting the current architecture.

`Key Differences`:

- Microsoft: `Top-down`, ecosystem-wide transformation, Agents enable cross-system collaboration—more disruptive but harder to implement.
- Salesforce: `Bottom-up`, incremental optimization, Agents are tightly coupled with vertical domains—easier to deploy but less revolutionary.
