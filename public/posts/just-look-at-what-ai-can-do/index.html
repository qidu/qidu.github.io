And I find that whenever I do this myself, everything works out so much better. But it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a constant struggle with one&rsquo;s emotion.

<p>&ldquo;There is something a little different going on right now. Anything which I can learn, anything which any one of you can learn, the AI could do as well. How do we know this, by the way? How can I be so sure? The reason is that all of us have a brain, and the brain is a biological computer. That&rsquo;s why we have a brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brain is a biological computer. So why can&rsquo;t the digital computer—a digital brain—do the same things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, very difficult to imagine. It&rsquo;s very difficult to internalize and to really believe on an emotional level. Even I struggle with it.“</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m really condensing a lot into a small amount of information here—in time here. But overall, by simply <code>looking at what AI can do</code>, not ignoring it, when the time comes, that will generate the energy that&rsquo;s required to overcome the huge challenge that AI will pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in some sense, whether you like it or not, your life is going to be affected by AI to a great extent. And so <code>looking at it, paying attention, and then generating the energy to solve the problems that will come up</code>.&rdquo;</p>
