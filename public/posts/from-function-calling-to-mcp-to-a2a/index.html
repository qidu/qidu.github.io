A2A and MCP

An A2A Server (a remote agent) could also expose some of its skills as MCP-compatible resources, especially if those skills are well-defined and can be invoked in a more tool-like.
Other agent might &ldquo;discover&rdquo; this A2A agent&rsquo;s specific skill via an MCP-style tool description (from its Agent Card).
A2A is about agents partnering on tasks, while MCP is more about agents using capabilities.
A2A for inter-agent collaboration and MCP for tool integration.
A2A facilitates the higher-level, conversational, and task-oriented interactions between partners.
MCP enables some agents to use specific, structured tools to perform specific functions.

<p>An agent interacts with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools &amp; Resources: typically primitives with well-defined, structured inputs and outputs, perform specific, often stateless, functions.</li>
<li>Agents: Autonomous systems. They can reason, plan, use multiple tools, maintain state over longer interactions, and engage in complex, often multi-turn dialogues to achieve novel or evolving tasks. Then are less predictable than a simple tool.</li>
<li>Agents may colaborate with other agents or call MCP tools, and MCP tools are waiting for calling from agents or LLMs through mcp clients.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">Function Calling</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Agent or Program should define every functions specificly again and again:</p>
<ol>
<li>User defines Tools(Functions) in local codes.</li>
<li>User send function definitions to LLM by system prompts or specific fields of LLM API.</li>
<li>LLM tells user what tool to call next.</li>
<li>User then calls the function in local codes.</li>
<li>User sends function return value to LLM to get more readable responses.

<p>Define Tools ( MCP Servers) just once, Calling it anywhere by any users selected LLMs repeatly:</p>
<ul>
<li>MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP tools.</li>
<li>MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers to retrive each tool context.</li>
<li>MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific tools(functions) definitions and capabilities as standardized Model Context Protocol. They may run locally, or run in Cloud exposing with HTTP/SSE or Streamable HTTP. <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">Find servers</a></li>
<li>Local Data Sources: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can access locally.</li>
<li>Remote Services: Cloud Services (e.g., PaaS, SaaS and other services APIs) that MCP servers can connect to.</li>

<li>May use RAG and vector db to retrive some relative tools contexts (NOT all tools), and pass to LLM each time.</li>
