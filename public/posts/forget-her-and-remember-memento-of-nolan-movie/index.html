<p>Forget &ldquo;Her&rdquo;, Nolan&rsquo;s old movie &ldquo;Memento&rdquo; maybe is a compulsory course for LLM Agents.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Last year(2024), from Chatbot to Voice Agent demo, &ldquo;Intention recognition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Multi-round dialogue&rdquo; are expected as the key capabilities
of an idea AGI system.</p>
<p>But in this year(2025), Agents can &ldquo;think&rdquo; and &ldquo;act&rdquo; for a goal by tasks breaking down, tools calling and self planning are invented and used more in reality life, and especially in programing works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Her&rdquo; is still far away, and &ldquo;He&rdquo; (Leonard, the key role of 《Memento》) comes true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Same challenges of &ldquo;He&rdquo; (Leonard) and AI Agents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to execute a stateful system that is inherently stateless and has an extremely limited memory window (or information overload) that requires long-term, statefulness, complex tasks to track?</p></blockquote>
<p>The solution is building a powerful external system for the &ldquo;short-term memory&rdquo; brain or &ldquo;limited context window&rdquo; LLM, which we call context engineering today.</p>
<p>Three Pillars of <code>Context Engineering</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No.1 <code>External Knowledge Management</code>: Such as Leonard&rsquo;s Polaroid Photos
<ul>
<li>Information Capture: preverve key infos for later needs.</li>
<li>Context Annotation: get judgment and insights behind raw data.</li>
<li>On-Demand Retrieval: retrive relevant historical knowledge at the precise moments when it needs to make a decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No.2 <code>Context Distillation &amp; Structuring</code>: Such as Key notes
<ul>
<li>Distillation &amp; Compression: distills countless clues and inferences into an unchangeable &ldquo;assertion&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Structuring: ensures that the most important information has the highest &ldquo;read priority&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No.3 <code>Hierarchical Memory Management</code>: such as Tattoo System
<ul>
<li>Core Mission Layer - Tattoo: The information at this layer is immutable and has the highest decision weight.</li>
<li>Episodic Working Memory - Photos and Notes: This layer is Read/Write, which records the intermediate steps of the task, the obstacles encountered, and the evidence collected.</li>
<li>Volatile Processing Window - 15 minutes of brain memory: This corresponds directly to the limited context window of the LLM,  It is where the real &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; takes place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leonard&rsquo;s two tragedies, or two &ldquo;Fatal Loopholes&rdquo; in Agent&rsquo;s Design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loophole 1: <code>External poisoning</code> - &ldquo;fed&rdquo; lies by Officer Teddy</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note the risk of Context Poisoning, or &ldquo;Garbage In, Gospel Out&rdquo; risk.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loophole 2: <code>Internal contamination</code> - being deceived by your own notes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This reveals a more hidden vulnerability than the External Poisoning: the <code>Self-Reinforcing Cognitive Prison</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conclusion: Agent needs <code>Verification &amp; Reflection</code> module
The agent system needs to have a mechanism to compare the gap between the results of the action and the expected goal, generate an &ldquo;error report&rdquo;, and use this report as a key context input for the next action.</p>
