<ul>
<li>Microsoft adopts a &ldquo;Universal Platform&rdquo; strategy, aiming to build an <code>AI operating system</code> that reshapes the software ecosystem by overhauling its underlying architecture. Its Agents act as cross-system intelligent hubs, replacing traditional databases and business logic, shifting from an &ldquo;App Stack&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Agent Stack&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Salesforce follows a &ldquo;Vertical Integration&rdquo; approach, embedding Agents deeply into <code>CRM and specific workflows</code> within its existing SaaS business, enhancing task autonomy without disrupting the current architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Key Differences</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft: <code>Top-down</code>, ecosystem-wide transformation, Agents enable cross-system collaboration—more disruptive but harder to implement.</li>
<li>Salesforce: <code>Bottom-up</code>, incremental optimization, Agents are tightly coupled with vertical domains—easier to deploy but less revolutionary.</li>
